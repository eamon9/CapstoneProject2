    <h2 onclick="toggleSection('programming-details')">My Programming Journey +</h2>
    <div id="programming-details" class="hidden">
      <p>I have hands-on experience with programming languages like Java, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
        Driven by self-learning, I have completed multiple courses on platforms such as YouTube, Codecademy, and Udemy.
      </p>
      <p>During my internship at Accenture, I spent six months working with SAP systems and learned Java. I supported
        projects with presentations, documentation, and contributed to the team. Although my time there ended without a
        continuation, I gained valuable experience that strengthened my programming skills.</p>
      <p>I also developed a warehouse application for visually organizing and locating documents within a shelving
        system using JUnit, MySQL, and JavaFX. Alongside, I explored database visualization and improved project
        organization using Trello.</p>

    <h2 onclick="toggleSection('experience-details')">Work Experience +</h2>
    <div id="experience-details" class="hidden">
      <p>With a rich background in the culinary industry, I have held positions from cleaner and stock receiver to chef,
        senior chef, and even acting manager. Each role helped me build resilience, creativity, and teamwork skills that
        now support my programming career.</p>
      <p>In parallel, I worked in an archiving company, managing tasks such as document organization, client
        consultations, and finding innovative solutions to improve efficiency. These experiences cultivated my attention
        to detail and problem-solving abilities.</p>
      <p>Due to recent health changes, I transitioned away from physically demanding work and have spent the last three
        years preparing for a career in programming. I am excited to bring my unique perspective and skills into this
        field.</p>
